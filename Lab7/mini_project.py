SAMPLE_TEXT = """
Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability 
with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple 
programming paradigms, including structured, object-oriented, and functional programming. Artificial intelligence and 
machine learning rely heavily on Python because of its extensive libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn. 
Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language. 
It was released in 1991. The name Python comes from the British comedy television show Monty Python's Flying Circus.
